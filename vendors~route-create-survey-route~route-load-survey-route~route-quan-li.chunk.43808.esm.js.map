In Dexie v1.4.0, I've rewritten the Promise class entirely. Just some fragments of promise-light is left. I use\n// another strategy now that simplifies everything a lot: to always execute callbacks in a new micro-task, but have an own micro-task\n// engine that is indexedDB compliant across all browsers.\n// Promise class has also been optimized a lot with inspiration from bluebird - to avoid closures as much as possible.\n// Also with inspiration from bluebird, asyncronic stacks in debug mode.\n//\n// Specific non-standard features of this Promise class:\n// * Custom zone support (a.k.a. PSD) with ability to keep zones also when using native promises as well as\n//   native async / await.\n// * Promise.follow() method built upon the custom zone engine, that allows user to track all promises created from current stack frame\n//   and below + all promises that those promises creates or awaits.\n// * Detect any unhandled promise in a PSD-scope (PSD.onunhandled). \n//\n// David Fahlander, https://github.com/dfahlander\n//\n\n// Just a pointer that only this module knows about.\n// Used in Promise constructor to emulate a private constructor.\nvar INTERNAL = {};\n\n// Async stacks (long stacks) must not grow infinitely.\nconst\n    LONG_STACKS_CLIP_LIMIT = 100,\n    // When calling error.stack or promise.stack, limit the number of asyncronic stacks to print out. \n    MAX_LONG_STACKS = 20,\n    ZONE_ECHO_LIMIT = 100,\n    [resolvedNativePromise, nativePromiseProto, resolvedGlobalPromise] = typeof Promise === 'undefined' ?\n        [] :\n        (()=>{\n            let globalP = Promise.resolve();\n            if (typeof crypto === 'undefined' || !crypto.subtle)\n                return [globalP, getProto(globalP), globalP];\n            // Generate a native promise (as window.Promise may have been patched)\n            const nativeP = crypto.subtle.digest(\"SHA-512\", new Uint8Array([0]));\n            return [\n                nativeP,\n                getProto(nativeP),\n                globalP\n            ];\n        })(),\n    nativePromiseThen = nativePromiseProto && nativePromiseProto.then;\n\nexport const NativePromise = resolvedNativePromise && resolvedNativePromise.constructor;\nconst patchGlobalPromise = !!resolvedGlobalPromise;\n\nvar stack_being_generated = false;\n\n/* The default function used only for the very first promise in a promise chain.\n   As soon as then promise is resolved or rejected, all next tasks will be executed in micro ticks\n   emulated in this module.
